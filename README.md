# Bailey Mejia Portfolio

## Description 

Starting my portfolio I wanted it to touch on who I am as a person and what I love to do on my spare time.
Using new skills from HTML and CSS I created my own portfolio webpage from scratch and included all my favorite photos I have taken in the past few years.
I wanted the page to be simple and get straight to the point of sharing my work and who I am, I divided my work into two categories called Nature, and City to demonstrate my expertise in those areas.
Developing my website I used semantic HTML elements to make the code more organized and used the CSS flexbox model design to layout the page and its items. 
I included media screens to make the site responsive for mobile viewing.
